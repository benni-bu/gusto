# ML-accelerated Linear Solvers for Semi-Implicit Atmospheric Models
Project repository for working on a simple implementation of a machine-learned preconditioner in the Gusto dynamical core toolkit, in the hope that we can show potential for improved speed and parallel scaleability over existing linear solver architectures. For now, the implementation will be for the shallow-water equations only.
