# ML-accelerated Linear Solvers for Semi-Implicit Atmospheric Models
Project repository for working on a simple implementation of a machine-learned preconditioner in the Gusto dynamical core toolkit, in the hope that we can show potential for improved speed and parallel scaleability in over existing linear solver architectures. For now, implementation will be for shallow-water equations only.
